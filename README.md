pnwmoths-label-matcher
======================

Script that finds all species records which match an image label on species, genus,
date, collection, state, and county. Due to an overhaul on how we treat species
images, it is no longer necessary to have image label info in two seperate records in the
database. The script provides a way to remove unneeded duplicates.

To work, this script needs to be run from "pnwmoths/app".
